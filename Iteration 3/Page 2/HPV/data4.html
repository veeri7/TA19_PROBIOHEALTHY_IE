            <h3>Caveats/footnotes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Age-standardised rates are the number of deaths from cervical cancer per 100,000 females,
                    age-standardised to the Australian population at 30 June 2001.</li>
                <li>Deaths from 1982 to 2014 were derived by year of death; deaths in 2015 were derived by year of
                    registration of death.</li>
                <li>Deaths registered in 2013 and earlier are based on the final version of cause-of-death data; deaths
                    registered in 2014 and 2015 are based on revised and preliminary versions, respectively, and are
                    subject to further revision by the ABS. </li>
                <li>Cause of Death Unit Record File data are provided to the AIHW by the Registries of Births, Deaths
                    and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System (managed by the Victorian Department of
                    Justice) and include cause of death coded by the ABS. The data are maintained by the AIHW in the
                    National Mortality Database.
