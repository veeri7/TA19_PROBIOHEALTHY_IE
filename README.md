HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual contact. HPV infection can be serious. It can cause cancers, including cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis and anus, and some head and neck cancers. About 8.5% of women in the general population are estimated to har- bour cervical HPV-16/18 infection at a given time, and 76.1% of invasive cervical cancers are attributed to HPVs 16 or 18. Here we are focussing on female group who are not aware of this virus and don't attend GP regularly. Therefore, an IT application about the HPV topic is developed, to increase peopleâ€™s awareness of their health against this virus. This application is designed like a health assessment questionnaire by providing current body conditions, and the outcome is a result about the possibility rate of affecting with this virus.

Our web page starts with introduction about immunisation tips and next focusses on Human Pappiloma Virus (HPV) & if it gets serious, Cervical Cancer & Breast Cancer stats & immunisation tips are provided.

Iteration 1:

Iteration 1 completely focusses on HPV which gives the user to know about their health conditions and predict ther possibility of having the HPV and suggestions to attend GP.

Iteration 2:

In this iteration we had used bootstrap template for our web-design where it will give detail insights about Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) from various sections,
A detailed video is made under "About Us" Section which gives the information about the usage of our website.
From our website, following insights can be taken out:
1. How HPV is spread?
2. Types of HPV
3. Symptoms 
4. Prevention
 All those insights are observed through some interactive visualisations made using plotly under "HPV Facts" Section.
 
 Few infographics are also made on Types of HPV & How it is spread?
